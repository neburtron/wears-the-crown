In the cycle of life, love and nourishment are intertwined. Just as a shepherd guides and provides for their flock, so too does the universe tend to our every need. The love we receive is matched by the love we give, creating a balance that sustains us on our journey. May we be open to receiving the abundance of love and nourishment that surrounds us, and may we in turn share it with others.
