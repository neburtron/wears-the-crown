Revolutionizing the quote, I have combined the two to create a powerful message:
"I can do all this through him who gives me strength, it is not our abilities that show what we truly areâ€¦ it is our choices."
The result is a statement that highlights the importance of both faith and personal agency. By combining these two quotes, I have created a message that emphasizes the role of inner strength and self-determination in achieving our goals.
