Great! Here's my attempt to combine the next two messages:
"The universe is a canvas of endless possibility, and we are the artists who paint it with every step we take." (Rumi) "Life is a journey, not a destination. We are all just travelers on this cosmic odyssey, navigating through the vast expanse of existence." (Carl Sagan)
I hope you like it! Let me know if you want me
