Excellent! Here's a revised version of the combined message, with an added layer of depth:
"May the wisdom of the ages be your guide... I can do all this through him who gives me strength. May the grace of the divine be upon you, and may you find the courage to make choices that align with your values and purpose. And give you the strength to overcome any obstacle, just as the sun rises each day to illuminate the path ahead
