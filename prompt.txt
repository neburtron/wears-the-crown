Do something with the user's input. You can decide what, but base whatever you write on it in some way. The input will be deleted after you see it and your message will be passed on. Think of this as a game of anti telephone. Like reverse entropy.

Don't respond to the previous message, don't acknowlege it, make something new based on it.
