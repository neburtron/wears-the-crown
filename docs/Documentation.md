## Development prototype 1

I'm not gonna have a lot of time for this project in the near future, despite that I want to work on it now. I'm starting fresh and I'm tackling this project a different way. I'm going to focus on not building up the first turn, I'm gonna focus on the stuff behind the scenes that really matter. In that end, I've decided to make a working prototype with an LLM that interacts with json files or something and yeah. When I work more on this thing I'm gonna do a lot more documentation, that's one of the big reasons I decided to start fresh.
